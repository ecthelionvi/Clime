Clime.zip is a weather application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions in cities around the world. 

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Users can enter a city name into the search bar to fetch the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The weather data is displayed alongside cute illustrated weather icons that match the conditions.
